## About the project:
The project is a [Scandiweb's](www.scandiweb.com) test assignment - a simple e-commerce app with backend endpoint;
The design looks like that: https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-Public?node-id=0%3A1 
The backend is accessible via graphQL;
I decided not to use Redux for state management and used react native component state instead.


## how to setup

### installing backend:
* First set the backend endpoint: 
* git clone https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint.git;
* install dependancies: npm install; 
* npm run build;
* npm start;
The GraphQL server will be accessible at localhost:4000;

### installing front-end:
